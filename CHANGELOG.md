## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial release: `SpawnRunTaskOperator` — an Apache Airflow operator that runs a
  task's command on an ephemeral EC2 instance via spore-host/spawn, auto-sized
  from `cpus`/`memory_gib` via truffle, launched with a TTL and `--on-complete
  terminate`, with a durable `.exitcode`-in-S3 completion signal. Deferrable (frees
  the worker slot while the instance runs) via `SpawnExitCodeTrigger`. The Airflow
  sibling of nf-spawn, miniwdl-spawn, cwl-spawn, and snakemake-executor-plugin-spawn.
