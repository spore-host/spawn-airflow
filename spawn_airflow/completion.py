"""Durable job-completion signalling via an ``.exitcode`` object in S3.

Ported verbatim from miniwdl-spawn/nf-spawn (engine-agnostic). The ephemeral
instance self-terminates on job completion (``--on-complete terminate``), so we
cannot poll it over SSH afterward — a probe would hit a dead box forever. Instead
the staging script uploads ``<workdir>/.exitcode`` as the *last* action; its
presence in S3 is the durable "done" signal that outlives the instance, and its
contents are the exit status.
